Biodiversity, characterized by the diversity and assemblage of living organisms, plays
a vital role in defining regions and providing essential ecosystem services. However,
the decline in biodiversity due to factors like climate change, pollution, and habitat
destruction necessitates the assessment and conservation of species. Species Distribution
Models (SDMs) are widely used to predict species distribution based on environmental
data. This study focuses on using frogs as indicator species for SDMs due
to their abundance, sensitivity to environmental stress, and cost-effective sampling
methods. The integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and satellite
imagery enhances the accuracy of SDMs by providing precise environmental data.
Deep learning algorithms, specifically Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), offer improved
prediction capabilities for complex relationships in high-dimensional data. This research
aims to develop an MLP-based SDM to predict the occurrences of nine frog
species in selected regions. The study includes data collection on frog occurrences,
extraction of environmental variables, analysis of correlations, feature selection, hyperparameter
optimization, model development, and evaluation. The performance
of the MLP model is compared to existing techniques, and highly correlated features
are identified. The significance of this research lies in contributing to biodiversity
conservation, advancing species distribution modeling techniques, leveraging available
data and computing power, and providing insights into the relationships between
environmental factors and frog speciesâ€™ presence. The results demonstrate the potential
of MLP-based SDMs for accurate predictions and their importance in addressing biodiversity decline.
