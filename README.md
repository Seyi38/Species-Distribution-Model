# SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODEL
Biodiversity, characterized by the diversity and assemblage of living organisms, plays
a vital role in defining regions and providing essential ecosystem services. However,
the decline in biodiversity due to factors like climate change, pollution, and habitat
destruction necessitates the assessment and conservation of species. Species Distribution
Models (SDMs) are widely used to predict species distribution based on environmental
data. This project focused on using frogs as indicator species for SDMs due
to their abundance, sensitivity to environmental stress, and cost-effective sampling
methods. The integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and satellite
imagery enhances the accuracy of SDMs by providing precise environmental data.
Deep learning algorithms, specifically Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), offer improved
prediction capabilities for complex relationships in high-dimensional data. For this project,
I developed an MLP-based SDM to predict the occurrences of nine frog
species in selected regions. The performance
of the MLP model is compared to existing techniques such as Random Forest models, and highly correlated features
are identified. The significance of this research lies in contributing to biodiversity
conservation, advancing species distribution modeling techniques, leveraging available
data and computing power, and providing insights into the relationships between
environmental factors and frog speciesâ€™ presence. The results demonstrate the potential
of MLP-based SDMs for accurate predictions and their importance in addressing
biodiversity decline.

This project was based on EY's Better Working World 2022 Challenge https://github.com/EY-Data-Science-Program/2022-Better-Working-World-Data-Challenge.

### The Data
The data consisted of six (6) different datasets, which were combined to build
the species distribution model. The datasets comprised presence-only labeled data
that contained information on the occurrence of the nine (9) frog species and five (5)
other spatial-temporal datasets from GIS generated by remote sensing devices. They
contained information on the predictor variables such as the climatic conditions (i.e.,
temperature, water vapour) and environmental variables such as landcover, water
surface, and land elevation, as well as satellite images depicting vegetation cover.
